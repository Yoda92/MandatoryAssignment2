## Setup before running
To easily allow for multiple developers to use their own local database, we used Environment Variables to store the connection string. When using this application you need to either create an Environment Variable with the key `ReservationDB` and your connectionstring as the value. Otherwise you can just change the `optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(***)` in the file ` WebApplication > Startup.cs` to use your own string directly. This database uses MSSQL

After this is done you must run `dotnet ef database update` from your terminal/commandline, or otherwise update the database through Visual Studio.

The `StudentHelperContext` should seed the database with some dummy data.

## Info on security
The controllers will only allow certain users to access them, which means it will result in a HTTP-error if you do not have the right claims. To avoid bad UX the Nav-bar is filtered to only show the possible controllers you can access. Theres 2 claims: IsWaiter and IsReceptionist. These can be enabled on a user when creating the user.
